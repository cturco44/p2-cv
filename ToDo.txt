Matt:
1. Implement more thorough testing suite in Image_tests.cpp
    They're going to run a bunch of faulty functions against our test 
    suite and we lose points if we don't detect all of the erroneous ones
2. Write compute_energy_matrix function
3. Write find_minimal_vertical_seam function
4. Write resize.cpp file
5. Write seam_carve_width
6. Add 2 tests to processing_public_tests.cpp
